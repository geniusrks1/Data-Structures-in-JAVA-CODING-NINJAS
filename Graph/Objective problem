1. all trees are graph
2. maximum number of edges in undirected graph vC2=v(v-1)/2;
connected graph- we can reach one node any node
degree of any vertex= number of edges connected to that
connected compenets means = individulal connected sub graphs
a graph is complete graph and tree as well == complete graph means each vertex conected with very vertex=ans=2;
A: The number of odd degree vertices in a graph is even.
B: Sum of all degrees in a graph is even.
time complexity of finding an edge between two vertices using adjacency matrix mat[v1][v2]
