/*This approach uses 2 properties of XOR:
1. XOR of a number with itself is 0.
2. XOR of a number with 0 is number itself.
Let us understand this approach with the help of an example:
arr[]= 2 3 1 6 3 6 2
Taking their xor:
Answer = 2 ^ 3 ^ 1 ^ 6 ^ 3 ^ 6 ^ 2
Now XOR is associative and commutative, so I can write it as:
Answer = (2^2) ^ (3^3) ^ 1 ^ (6 ^ 6)
 = 0 ^ 0 ^ 1 ^ 0
 = 1
Time complexity of this solution is O(n) */
